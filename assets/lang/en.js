I am not afraid to keep studying and learning new things (in fact if necessary it is better) but I hate studying to get a \"piece of paper\". I love pure programming and development but at work I want to solve real problems in an innovative way! I work in teams in an agile way, I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging my leadership and problem solving skills to improve team performance and deliver impactful data solutions.",

The construction of these predictive models was trained and evaluated using a dataset, created during the thesis, of cells labelled with specialised doctors' help to classify as close as possible to clinical reality.

    "H-explanation": 'Given my passion for scouting, started at 2007 in the <a href="https://www.assoraider.it/">Assoraider organisation</a>, I never miss a chance to do all the activities that allow me to immerse myself in nature. I love to make new experiences and engage in mental and physical challenges that allow to refine all the techniques such as Camping, Pioneering, Trekking, Orienteering and Cooking with a wood fire, in one word <b>Adventure</b>! <br> I am continually discovering and experimenting with new technologies to learn new things and create small software projects that can be useful to me in my daily life or useful to those around me. Basic skills in woodworking, electrical and plumbing installation, first aid knowledge with a strong propensity to adapt to any situation, problem solving and conflict resolution.<br> Since I reached the legal age, after two training courses and experience with the previous chief, I have been a Capo Reparto (Chief) for three years (2014-2017). During this time, I was in charge of a group of 4 people of my age who, with me, managed and were responsible for 40 children from 11 to 15 years old. The management of this group was on al aspects, from the economic component to the management of regular activities. Throughout this period, every week, we organise recreational and educational activities for the whole group (organised in subgroups with their hierarchical structure) both within controlled spaces and in open spaces such as forests or rural areas. All the activities, organised according to a plan created at the beginning of the year, had a training objective to prepare and then make the boys live a scout camp experience. In addition to the year plan, a weekly plan was made to achieve the main objective and fill in the gaps that inevitably arise.<br>Every year, in August, a 7-10 day camp is organised. During the camp, all group members live together 24 hours a day and continuously carry out all kinds of activities while taking care, in a controlled but as much autonomous way, of the kitchen and all the small activities necessary for camp life (with tents and fire camp).<br>Having left the leadership of the group for study reasons (I moved to Pisa),  and during this time I was involved in the organization and management of the camps, in the role of camp leader, I was responsible for the organisation and management of food and material needed for the four units (similar groups but with different age ranges) for a total of about 150 people.<br>Started working, fortunately in remote working, I was able to resume my role as chief, which I still do, and at the same time I joined the executive committee of the local organization.',
