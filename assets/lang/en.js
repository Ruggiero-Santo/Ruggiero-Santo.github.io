The acquired videos were cleared, organized and precessed for training and benchmarking different deep learning models from action recognition literature. The developed models were also evaluated from a clinical perspective against expert medical opinion. </br> </br> The document is in English and all the work was carried out in complete autonomy in consultation with doctors with expertise in LUS for clinical validation. </br> Soon at least one paper will be published on this work, so more information will be added later.",

Machine learning algorithms such as multilevel neural networks and decision trees were applied, implemented, and subsequently compared to solve this problem. The construction of these predictive models was trained and evaluated using a dataset, created during the thesis, of cells labelled with specialised doctors' help to classify as close as possible to clinical reality. The results obtained from both models were then compared and evaluated to obtain a handy product that doctors could use. </br>",

    "SF-explanation": "Most of these skills, which I have just listed, were learnt during my scout life (started in 2007). I have participated in many group experiences in which the organisation, achievement of continuous goals, constant learning, and passing the acquired knowledge have been the day's order.<br>Since I reached the legal age, after two training courses and experience with the previous chief, I have been a Capo Reparto (Chief) for three years (2014-2017). During this time, I was in charge of a group of 4 people of my age who, with me, managed and were responsible for 40 children from 11 to 15 years old. The management of this group was on al aspects, from the economic component to the management of regular activities. Throughout this period, every week, we organise recreational and educational activities for the whole group (organised in subgroups with their hierarchical structure) both within controlled spaces and in open spaces such as forests or rural areas. All the activities, organised according to a plan created at the beginning of the year, had a training objective to prepare and then make the boys live a scout camp experience. In addition to the year plan, a weekly plan was made to achieve the main objective and fill in the gaps that inevitably arise.<br>Every year, in August, a 7-10 day camp is organised. During the camp, all group members live together 24 hours a day and continuously carry out all kinds of activities while taking care, in a controlled but as much autonomous way, of the kitchen and all the small activities necessary for camp life (with tents and fire camp).<br>Having left the leadership of the group for study reasons (I moved to Pisa), in the last camps, I was responsible for the organisation and management of food and material needed for the four units (similar groups but with different age ranges) for a total of about 150 people.<br>",
    "H-explanation": 'Given my passion for scouting (<a href="https://www.assoraider.it/">my scout organisation</a>), I never miss a chance to do all the activities that allow me to immerse myself in nature. I love to make new experiences and engage in mental and physical challenges and refine all the techniques such as Camping, Pioneering, Trekking, Orienteering and Cooking with a wood fire in all their facets. <br>I am continually discovering and experimenting with new technologies to learn new things and create small software projects that can be useful to me in my daily life or useful to those around me.<br>',
